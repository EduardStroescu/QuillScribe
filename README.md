Notes
</h2>

Deploying the WebSocket Gateway to Vercel will cause issues with the connection(resulting in no real-time) because of Vercel's edge functions' transfer limits.
To keep the functionality I've separated the gateway in its own repo <a href="https://github.com/EduardStroescu/quillscribe-socket-server" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>, deploy it to Railway, Koyeb or another platform which supports real-time connections.
